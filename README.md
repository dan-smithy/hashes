HashCracker
===========
Can be used to crack md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512 by using your choice of either dictionary attack or brute-force. Use of the program is simple - just follow the instructions given to you when you run the program. There is a smallish wordlist included (around 650,000 words) but there are much better online (there are many password dumps out there).
